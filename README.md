## Smart Wallet Scaffold ETH

This codebase is as an integration on top of [Scaffold-ETH 2](https://scaffoldeth.io/). I learned about Smart Wallets at Base House ETH Denveer, and got really excited to set this up and share with everyone!

## About Smart Wallet

- Provides capability to create wallets using passkey ([ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337))
- Removes hassle of remembering seed phrases and private keys
